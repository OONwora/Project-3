## Credit Card Fraud Detection
 Use JupyterLab to build a simple credit card fraud detection model. Utilize machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression or Random Forest to train a model on a labeled dataset and evaluate its performance.

Confronted by issues with their current fraud detection system, a prominent credit card enterprise is grappling with slow responsiveness in detecting novel fraud patterns, resulting in notable financial repercussions. In response, we have been commissioned to conceive and execute an algorithm aimed at swiftly and effectively singling out and signaling suspicious transactions for deeper examination. The dataset at hand encompasses two distinct tables: "cc_info," encompassing comprehensive credit card and cardholder information, and "transactions," housing specifics of credit card transactions spanning from August 1st to October 30th.
#
## Objectives
 - Create an advanced fraud detection system using machine learning.
 - Detect unusual transaction patterns and potential fraud.
 - Apply object-oriented programming (OOP) for a flexible and scalable solution.
 - Handle large data volumes efficiently.
 - Provide valuable insights to Company ABC for improved decision-making.
