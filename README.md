# Project-3

## Credit Card Fraud Detection:
 Use JupyterLab to build a simple credit card fraud detection model. Utilize machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression or Random Forest to train a model on a labeled dataset and evaluate its performance.
#
The provided dataset embodies an extensive fraud detection solution designed for a prominent credit card corporation, Company ABC. Employing neural networks and unsupervised learning methodologies, the notebook endeavors to pinpoint potentially deceitful transactions from the supplied dataset. The primary objective of the project is to enhance the current sluggish fraud detection mechanism by crafting a more proficient and precise model capable of flagging suspicious transactions, warranting deeper scrutiny.
